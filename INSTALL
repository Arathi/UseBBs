UseBB Development Version Installation
--------------------------------------

Until UseBB is in a stable state, this guide will remain very simple.

Before installing UseBB, make sure your host accords to the minimal system requirements.
Please see http://www.usebb.net/features/#backend_requirements

3. Edit config.php to your preferences.
4. Upload all the files to your host.
