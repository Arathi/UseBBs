UseBB Development Version Installation
--------------------------------------

Until UseBB is in a stable state, this guide will remain very simple.

Before installing UseBB, make sure your host accords to the minimal system requirements.
* Minimal: HTTP-server supporting PHP, PHP 4.1.0, MySQL 3.23
* Recommended: GNU/Linux, most recent versions of Apache, PHP and MySQL

You might want to use install/install.php to quickly set up your board. Otherwise, you
can follow these directions:

1. Execute install/usebb.sql on your database. Currently, UseBB needs 10 tables.
3. Edit config.php to your preferences.
4. Upload all the files to your host.
5. Delete the directory install/ for security reasons.
6. Register a first user. It will automatically be an administrator.
7. Test UseBB.
