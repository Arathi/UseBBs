UseBB Development Version Installation
--------------------------------------

Until UseBB is in a stable state, this guide will remain very simple.

Before installing UseBB, make sure your host accords to the minimal system requirements.
Please see http://www.usebb.net/features/#backend_requirements

1. Execute the SQL file on your database. Currently, UseBB needs 13 tables.
2. Adjust the rows in usebb_config to your preferences. YOU MUST DO THIS FOR CORRECT HANDLING!
3. Edit config.php to your host's settings.
4. Upload all the files to your host.
5. Register a first user. It will automatically be an admin (however this makes almost any difference for the moment).
6. Test UseBB.
