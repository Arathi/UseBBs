UseBB 2.0.0 pre-alpha installation
==================================

* Requirements

	* PHP >= 5.3.0
	* Doctrine DBAL 2.1
	* PHPUnit 3.6 (tests only)

Doctrine DBAL and PHPUnit can be installed through PEAR. They are not 
included in the source tree.

* Installation

Access the root of the web application in the web browser. The Simple Installer
module will list the steps to install the system and perform the database
installation.

The sources can be installed on a different location. Move every file except
index.php and dbConfig.php to the new location and adjust the value of
USEBB_ROOT_PATH in index.php. This way, multiple forums can share one
source tree.

* Testing

Make sure dbConfig.php has working database credentials and the database tables 
do not exist yet. In a command line window, go to the root UseBB directory and 
execute:

$ ./scripts/run-unit-tests.sh 

This will make PHPUnit run all tests in the source tree. Passing a path to a 
test case file will only run that test case.
