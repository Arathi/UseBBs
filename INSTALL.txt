UseBB 2.0.0 pre-alpha installation
==================================

* Requirements

	* PHP >= 5.3.0
	* Doctrine DBAL 2.2
	* MySQL (InnoDB), SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server
	* PHPUnit 3.6 (tests only)

Doctrine DBAL and PHPUnit can be installed through PEAR. They are not 
included in the source tree.

When using MySQL, only InnoDB is supported. MyISAM support - as used for years
with legacy PHP software such as UseBB 1 - is not supported due to the absence
of transactions and more.

* Installation

Access the root of the web application in the web browser. The Simple Installer
module will list the steps to install the system and perform the database
installation for the production/development environment.

Before using PHPUnit, the test database must be installed. Do so using:

$ php index.php --env=testing --install-db

The sources can be installed on a different location. Move every file except
index.php and dbConfig.php to the new location and define the value of
USEBB_ROOT_PATH in index.php. This way, multiple forums can share one
source tree.

* Testing

Make sure the testing database has been set up. In a command line window,
go to the root UseBB directory and execute:

$ phpunit .

This will make PHPUnit run all tests in the source tree. Passing a path to a 
test case file will only run that test case.
