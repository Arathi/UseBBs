UseBB 2 coding guidelines
-------------------------

1. UNIX file format
-------------------

All files need to be in the UNIX format, i.e. using line feeds (\n) line
ends. Thus, no carriage returns (\r) are allowed.

2. License
----------

All code and resources must be under the GNU General Public License, version
3 or a compatible license.

3. Minimal PHP version
----------------------

The PHP version used is PHP 5.2.x. PHP 5.3.x+ functionality is not allowed.

Please make note of the use of PHP 5 and use new PHP 5 functionality available
by default when possible. For example: SimpleXML, SPL, etc.

Unless there is a reasonable fallback, functionality not available by default
may not be used.

4. Error reporting level
------------------------

The error reporting level is E_ALL | E_STRICT. This may not be changed.

5. Object orientation
---------------------

UseBB 2 is written in object-oriented PHP. All functionality should be packed
into classes, not global procedural code or functions.

Classes that never need to be instantiated should contain an empty private
constructor:

<code>
private function __construct() {}
</code>

The methods of these classes must be defined as static methods.

6. Global scope
---------------

All identifiers in the global scope need to be unique and prefixed:
 * classes: UseBB_
 * constants: USEBB_
 * variables: usebb

7. Identifier naming
--------------------

All identifiers use camel case naming: someIdentifier. Classes begin with
a capital: SomeClass. As an exception, constants are all-caps and use
underscores: SOME_CONSTANT.

TRUE, FALSE and NULL are all-caps as well.

Make note of the use of prefixes in the global scope.

8. Docblocks
------------

Docblocks are mandatory for:
 * files that don't contain a class;
 * classes;
 * class constants;
 * all class methods.

For more information on phpDocumentor, see
http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLframesConverter/default/.

9. Comments
-----------

Next to the docblocks, regular comments can be used prefixed by two slashes
and a space. Example:

<code>
// This is a comment.
</code>

10. Beginning a new file
------------------------

Each file begins with the full PHP start tag (<?php), but has no end tag
(?>). The start tag is followed by the GNU GPL 3 declaration:

<code>
/*
	This file is part of UseBB.

	UseBB is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
	it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
	the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
	(at your option) any later version.

	UseBB is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
	but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
	MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
	GNU General Public License for more details.

	You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
	along with UseBB.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
*/
</code>

Following is the file/class level Docblock:

<code>
/**
 * File/class description
 *
 * @package UseBB
 * @subpackage subpackage, when present
 * @copyright Copyright (C) 2003-2008 Contributors
 * @license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html GNU General Public License
 * @version $Rev$
 *
 * @author author name <author address>
 */
</code>

Except for @subpackage, all tags need to be present. @package and @version
may not be altered.

Note each file may only contain one class. The filename should be equal to
the class name (minus prefix). When defining a subpackage, the file must be
placed in lib/UseBB/@subpackage/.

11. Indentation and whitespace
------------------------------

The style can roughly be compared with the Allman style
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style). Though, there are
a few differences.

Contents inside braces needs to be between two spaces. Example:

<code>
if ( $smt )
{
	self::doStuff();
}
</code>

Function/method parameters are not put between spaces, but a space is required
after each comma. Example:

<code>
$smt = str_replace('a', 'b', $smt);
</code>

When casting, the type and variable need to have a space in between. Example:

<code>
$smt = (string) $smt;
</code>

Indentation and brace placement also applies to array initalization. Example:

<code>
$bar = array
(
	'bar' => 'foo',
	'foo' => 'bar',
);
</code>

Note only tabs are used for indentation, no spaces are allowed.

12. Type hinting
----------------

Type hinting for class names and arrays is mandatory. Example:

<code>
public static function foo(UseBB_Topic $topic, array $options)
</code>

13. Comparing values and NULL
-----------------------------

Variables may only be compared as booleans when they only contain boolean
values. Example:

<code>
if ( $boolean ) {} // Good
if ( $string ) {} // Bad
if ( !empty($string) ) {} // Good
</code>

When a value can be a boolean (thus, isn't always a boolean) or NULL, ===
or !== needs to be used. Example:

<code>
if ( $this->xml !== FALSE ) {}
if ( $obj === NULL ) {}
</code>
