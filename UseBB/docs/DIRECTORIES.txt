FAQ
---

 * What needs to be publicly available?
    * /index.php
    * /js/

 * Why is UseBB treated as a library itself?
   So it can be moved to a central location on the server, per library or as a
   whole. This eases updating and using the source for multiple forums. The
   paths can be set in index.php, and this file does not need updating on new
   versions.
