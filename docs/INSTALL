UseBB Development Version Installation
--------------------------------------

Until UseBB is in a stable state, this guide will remain very simple.

Before installing UseBB, make sure your host accords to the minimal system requirements.
* Minimal: HTTP-server supporting PHP, PHP 4.1.0, MySQL 3.23
* Recommended: GNU/Linux, most recent versions of Apache, PHP and MySQL

UseBB is being tested continually with recent versions of PHP 4 and MySQL 4.0.
It was also tested and confirmed to work on PHP 5.1.0RC4 with MySQL 4.1.15 using the mysqli driver.

You might want to use install/install.php to quickly set up your board. Otherwise, you can follow these directions:

1. Execute install/schemas/mysql.sql and install/usebb.sql on your database. Currently, UseBB needs 12 tables.
2. Rename config.php-dist to config.php and edit to your preferences. You might want to use http://usebb.sourceforge.net/docs/doku.php?id=configuration:config.php_guide
3. Upload all the files to your host.
4. Delete the directory install/ for security reasons.
5. Chmod config.php so that it is writable by the webserver (try chmod 777).
6. Register a first user. It will automatically be an administrator.
7. Test UseBB.
