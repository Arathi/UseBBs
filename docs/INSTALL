UseBB Development Version Installation
--------------------------------------

Until UseBB is in a stable state, this guide will remain very simple.

Before installing UseBB, make sure your host accords to the minimal system requirements.
* Minimal: HTTP-server supporting PHP, PHP 4.1.0, MySQL 3.23
* Recommended: GNU/Linux, most recent versions of Apache, PHP and MySQL

UseBB is being tested continually with recent versions of PHP 4 with MySQL 4.0,
and PHP 5.1.1 with MySQL 4.1.15 using the mysqli driver.

--------------------------------------

To install UseBB, you have two choices:

- Use the automatic installer:
	1. Rename config.php-dist to config.php.
	2. Chmod config.php so that it is writable by the webserver (try chmod 0777).
		(not necessary but recommended)
	3. Use the installation wizard, located at install/index.php.

	-OR-

- Install the board manually:
	1. Execute install/schemas/mysql.sql and install/usebb.sql on your database.
	2. Rename config.php-dist to config.php and edit to your preferences.
	3. Upload all the files to your host.
	4. Delete the directory install/ for security reasons.
	5. Chmod config.php so that it is writable by the webserver (try chmod 0777).
		(not necessary but recommended)
	6. Register a first user. It will automatically be an administrator.
