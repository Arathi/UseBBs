Note to users of MySQL 4.1/5.x and strict mode enabled
------------------------------------------------------

If you upgrade to MySQL 4.1 or 5.x and strict mode is enabled, you will need to
execute the SQL file install/mysql-strict-changes.sql on your database. Eventually
change the table prefixes in the file first.

This fix is applied to new installs by default.
