		</ul>	

		<h2 id="spam-ip">Known spammers' IP addresses</h2>

		<p>Databases such as <a href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/">Stop Forum Spam</a> keep a list of known spammers, their IP addresses, user names and email addresses. UseBB can use some of this data to automatically check and block forum access for these spammers.</p>

		<p>IP addresses in the Stop Forum Spam database can be blocked using "DNSBL bans" (available since 1.0 RC1, May 2006). This is generally fast and without query limit.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>In the ACP, enter General Configuration and click Security.</li>
			<li>Tick "Enable IP address banning" and "Enable DNSBL powered banning".</li>
			<li>Save the form.</li>
			<li>Enter the DNSBL Bans pane.</li>
			<li>In the server list, add <code>dnsbl.tornevall.org</code>. Other settings can remain as-is.</li>
			<li>Save the form.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>With every attempt to register or post, the IP address will be checked and eventually blocked.</p>

		<h2 id="spam-email">Known spammers' email addresses</h2>

		<p>Email addresses from the Stop Forum Spam database can be used as well, but this can not be done using DNSBL bans. Instead, since UseBB 1.0.13 it is possible to use Stop Forum Spam's API to check the email address upon registration or profile changes.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>In the ACP, enter General Configuration and click Security.</li>
			<li>Tick "Check email addresses with Stop Forum Spam".</li>
			<li>Eventually, change the "minimal frequency" and "last seen" settings.</li>
			<li>Tick "Save blocked email addresses in the forum's ban table" to save the blocked addresses in the forum's bans.</li>
			<li>Save the form.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="random-questions">Custom anti-spam questions</h2>

		<p>Custom anti-spam questions can be used to somewhat block automatic bots from the forum, given that the answers to the questions can not be easily calculated or derived, and the questions are changed regularly.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>In the ACP, enter General Configuration and click Security.</li>
			<li>Change the setting "Anti-spam question mode" to "Randomly chosen custom question".</li>
			<li>Enter questions in the form of <code>question|answer</code> in the field "Custom anti-spam questions".</li>
			<li>Save the form.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Please note that this does not block human spammers, or bots that have been updated with the correct answers.</p>

		<h2 id="remove-account">Removing spam accounts and posts</h2>

		<p>It is easy to remove all traces of a spam account.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Enter the account's profile page and click the Delete link (when logged in as administrator).</li>
			<li>Tick "Permanently delete the user's posts".</li>
			<li>Optionally choose to also ban the given email address and last used IP address (only if IP banning is enabled).</li>
			<li>If a Stop Forum Spam API key is set*, you can choose to submit the user information to the database.</li>
			<li>Click Delete.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>* To set an API key, register and request one at <a href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/">stopforumspam.com</a>, enter the ACP at "General Configuration" -&gt; "Security" and enter the key in the field "Stop Forum Spam API key".</p>

		<h2 id="avoid-profile-spam">Avoiding profile spam</h2>

		<p>TODO</p>

		<h2 id="hide-profile-spam">Hiding profile spam</h2>

		<p>Profile spam are links added to the profile's website field or signature. When these are invisible to guests, the spam attempt has basically failed.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>In the ACP, enter General Configuration and click User rights.</li>
			<li>Untick "Guests can view member profiles".</li>
			<li>Save the form.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="clean-profile-spam">Mass cleaning up profile spam accounts</h2>

		<p>You can prune all profile spam accounts using member pruning.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>In the ACP, enter Prune Members.</li>
			<li>Select "Profile spam accounts" and enter any number of days in the field below.</li>
			<li>You can see a preview using the "Preview Members" button.</li>
			<li>Tick "I understand this action is irreversible" and click "Start Pruning".</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="and-more">And more...?</h2>

		<p>For UseBB 1 &ndash; without a plug-in or modules system &ndash; we have chosen to implement a limited set of useful anti-spam measures. Stop Forum Spam integration is one of those (and probably the only non-generic/third-party one).</p>
		<p>For later major versions (2 and on) the goal is to have more third party anti-spam features implemented as separate modules, letting the end-user choose which one to use.</p>
