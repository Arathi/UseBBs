UseBB Documentation
===================

Welcome to UseBB's documentation. These are created to (finally) provide some official manuals to both
end-users as developers on how to use and develop the new UseBB 2 (and later) forum system.

We hope these end up being useful and will continue keeping them updated to the latest stable version.

.. note::
   This documentation does not apply to the classic UseBB 1 package. UseBB 1 was a different system, 
   now being phased out and soon out of support. For help, please consult the community forums.

Should there be any error, mistake, shortcoming, etc, please open a bug report or edit the manual's 
source code on Git.
